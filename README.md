# Hall-Magnetic-Sensor-Tachometer


C++ Arduino Sketch which will take the digital input from a Hall Magnetic Field Sensor
and allow you to work out the RPM of a motor or engine by counting the number of interupts 
received and plotting them over time to get the RPM being measured by the sensor and print
it to the serial output of an Arduino for capture by any other serial device.
